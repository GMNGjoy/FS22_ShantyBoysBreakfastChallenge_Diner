# Shanty Boys' Breakfast Challenge Diner
On the map [Split Mountain Ranch](https://www.farming-simulator.com/mod.php?lang=en&country=us&mod_id=265340&title=fs2022) by SilverEagle, the **ShantyBoys Breakfast challenge extra game mode tasks you with producing breakfast for the _ShantyBoys_. Since the current challenge guidelines state that you have to make 50 pallets of Pancakes, Donuts, Eggs, and Pork - you'll need somewhere to store those pallets until the challenge is complete.

This is where the Breakfast Challenge Diner comes in! The Diner is essentially a object storage building where you don't need to see the objects being stored. The building is setup to hold 1000 objects, more than you'll need to get the challenge complete.

Drop off area by the front door, spawn area (with trigger) by the back door.

The diner even has a customized sign!
